# Computer Vision Repository

This repository contains code and resources related to computer vision research and applications. Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand visual data like images and videos. 

## Contents

This repository contains the following:

- Image classification models: Code and notebooks for training and evaluating image classification models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, etc.

- Object detection models: Code and notebooks for training and using object detection models like YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN on datasets like PASCAL VOC, COCO, OpenImages, etc.

- Image segmentation models: Code and notebooks for semantic segmentation and instance segmentation using models like Mask R-CNN, DeepLab, etc.

- Computer vision theory and concepts: Reference notebooks explaining computer vision concepts like image filters, feature extraction, object tracking, etc.

- Tutorials and examples: End-to-end tutorials for solving different computer vision tasks using OpenCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.

## Getting Started

The code was developed and tested on Python 3.6+. To set up:

1. Clone this repository 
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for demos and examples

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! Feel free to contribute tutorials, fixes, documentation updates, or additions to the code.
